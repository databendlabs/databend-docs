## What You can Contribute

Share your expertise by contributing documents for new functions or commands you develop, or even improvements to existing sections. We also welcome your input for error spotting or suggestions for clarification. While the "Releases" section is dedicated to official updates, every other part of the documentation is open for your insights.

## How to Contribute

To ensure a smooth collaboration process, we recommend following these best practices:

1. Fork and Branch:

- We recommend forking the repository on GitHub and creating a new branch for your edits. This allows for better version control and easier tracking of changes.
- Edit the documentation on your branch and submit a Pull Request (PR) when you are ready for review.

2. Follow Existing Formats: For consistency, follow the existing documentation format. For example, if you are adding documentation for a new function, consider copying an existing markdown file from the same folder and modifying it accordingly.

3. Preview Locally:

- To preview your changes locally and ensure they meet your expectations, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)(Please install a version greater than 20) installed on your machine. Run the following commands in your terminal to initiate a local preview:

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn run dev
```

- Confirm that the formatting is correct, links work as intended, and the content aligns with your vision BEFORE you submit.

## Versioning

The Databend documentation website always showcases the latest content for the product. To indicate when specific features, such as commands or functions, were introduced or modified, insert a code snippet like this:

```markdown
import FunctionDescription from '@site/src/components/FunctionDescription';

<FunctionDescription description="Introduced or updated: v1.2.34"/>
```
