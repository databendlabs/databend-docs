title: Connecting with JDBC
---

Databend Cloud provides a JDBC driver that enables connection to Databend Cloud from a client application, such as [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.com/). DBeaver comes with numerous pre-configured drivers for SQL, NoSQL, key-value databases, graph databases, search engines, and more. However, the Databend JDBC driver is not currently pre-configured in DBeaver, which means that you cannot locate and select Databend Cloud while creating a connection in the application. Nevertheless, you can manually add the driver to DBeaver, allowing you to establish a connection to Databend Cloud in the same way you would with a pre-configured database.

The following shows how to add the Datebend JDBC driver to a client application and connect to Databend Cloud via the driver, using DBeaver as an example. For more information about the driver, refer to https://github.com/databendcloud/databend-jdbc

## Example: Connect from DBeaver with JDBC

To connect to Databend Cloud from DBeaver with the Databend JDBC driver, you need to add the driver to DBeaver's Driver Manager first, and then select the driver when you create a connection.

### Step 1. Add Databend JDBC Driver to DBeaver

1. In DBeaver, select **Database** > **Driver Manager** to open the Driver Manager, then click **New** to create a new driver.

2. On the **Settings** tab, enter the required information for the new driver as follows:

    - **Driver**: databendcloud
    - **Driver Type**: Generic
    - **Class Name**: com.databend.jdbc.DatabendDriver
    - **URL Template**: jdbc:databend://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{database}
    - **Default Port**: 443
    - **Default User**: cloudapp
