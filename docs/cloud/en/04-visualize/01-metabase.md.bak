[Metabase](https://www.metabase.com) is an open-source business intelligence tool. Metabase lets you ask questions about your data, and displays answers in formats that make sense, whether thatâ€™s a bar chart or a detailed table.

You can save your questions, and group questions into handsome dashboards. Metabase also makes it easy to share questions and dashboards with the rest of your team.
