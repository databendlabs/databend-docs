[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) is a visual analytics platform transforming the way we use data to solve problemsâ€”empowering people and organizations to make the most of their data. By leveraging the [databend-jdbc driver](https://github.com/databendcloud/databend-jdbc) (version 0.0.8 or higher), Databend Cloud seamlessly integrates with Tableau, enabling seamless data access and efficient analysis. It is important to note that for optimal compatibility, it is advisable to use Tableau version 2023.1.0 or higher to avoid potential compatibility issues. 

In the following tutorial, you will find a detailed, step-by-step guide on deploying and integrating Tableau Desktop with Databend Cloud.
