## Warehouse Pricing

Warehouses consume credits when they are running (to be more precise, in the Running state). The number of credits consumed depends on the warehouse's size and running time. An XSmall warehouse with 8 vCPUs only consumes 1 credit per hour.

Databend Cloud charges on a per-second basis. For example, if you have a Small warehouse running for three seconds, it will charge 0.00168 (0.000556 x 3) credit. Before you run a warehouse, make sure you have enough credits. To check your credit balance or buy more credits, go to **Organization** > **Billing**.

| Size (vCPUs) | Credits / Hour | Credits / Second |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| XSmall (8)             | $ 1                     | $ 0.000278
| Small (16)           | $ 2                       | $ 0.000556
| Medium (32)            | $ 4                       | $ 0.001111                    |
| Large (64)           | $ 8                       | $ 0.002222                    |
| XLarge (128)           | $ 16                       | $ 0.004444                    |

A suspended warehouse does not consume any credits. Databend Cloud automatically suspends a warehouse in case of no activities for five minutes to save your credits. Alternatively, you can always manually suspend a warehouse when your work is complete.
