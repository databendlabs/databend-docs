  Connecting to Databend with JDBC
---

Databend provides a JDBC driver that enables connection to Databend from a client application, such as [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.com/). DBeaver comes with numerous pre-configured drivers for SQL, NoSQL, key-value databases, graph databases, search engines, and more. However, the Databend JDBC driver is not currently pre-configured in DBeaver, which means that you cannot locate and select Databend while creating a connection in the application. Nevertheless, you can manually add the driver to DBeaver, allowing you to establish a connection to Databend in the same way you would with a pre-configured database.
