An aggregate function, or aggregation function, is a function that combines values from multiple rows to form a single summary value. Common aggregate functions include sum, count, avg, and others.

Databend allows you to customize your own aggregate functions with Rust. It's not an easy way because you need to be a rustacean first.

Databend has a plan to support writing UDAFs in other languages(like js, web assembly) in the future.

This section shows you how to write an aggregate function in Databend.

## Function Registration

The register function for aggregate functions takes a lowercase function name and an `AggregateFunctionDescription` object as parameters. Each registered function is stored in `case_insensitive_desc` (HashMap data structure).

The `case_insensitive_combinator_desc` is used to store combined functions, such as `count_if` and `sum_if` that are combined with the `_if` suffix.

```rust
pub struct AggregateFunctionFactory {
    case_insensitive_desc: HashMap<String, AggregateFunctionDescription>,
    case_insensitive_combinator_desc: Vec<(String, CombinatorDescription)>,
}
impl AggregateFunctionFactory {
  ...
pub fn register(&mut self, name: &str, desc: AggregateFunctionDescription) {
        let case_insensitive_desc = &mut self.case_insensitive_desc;
        case_insensitive_desc.insert(name.to_lowercase(), desc);
    }
  ...
}
```

Each registered function must implement both the `AggregateFunction` and `AggregateFunctionFeatures` traits,and the `AggregateFunctionFeatures` is similar to `FunctionProperty` in `Scalar` because they both store some properties of functions.

```rust
pub type AggregateFunctionRef = Arc<dyn AggregateFunction>;
pub type AggregateFunctionCreator =
    Box<dyn Fn(&str, Vec<Scalar>, Vec<DataType>) -> Result<AggregateFunctionRef> + Sync + Send>;
pub struct AggregateFunctionDescription {
    pub(crate) aggregate_function_creator: AggregateFunctionCreator,
    pub(crate) features: AggregateFunctionFeatures,
}
```

## Function Composition

Unlike `Scalar` directly using a `Struct`, `AggregateFunction` is a trait because aggregate functions accumulate data from the block and generate some intermediate results during the accumulation process.

Therefore, **Aggregate Function** must have an initial state, and the results generated during the aggregation process must be **mergeable** and **serializable**.

The main functions are:

- **name** represents the name of the function being registered, such as avg, sum, etc.
- **return_type** represents the return type of the registered function. The return value of the same function may change due to different parameter types. For example, the parameter of `sum(int8)` is of type `i8`, but the return value may be `int64`.
- **init_state** is used to initialize the state of the aggregate function.
- **state_layout** is used to represent the size of the **state** in memory and the arrangement of memory blocks.
- **accumulate** is used for `SingleStateAggregator`. That is, the entire block can be aggregated under a single state without any keys. For example, when `selecting count(*) from t`, there is no grouping column in the query, and the `accumulate` function will be called.
- **accumulate_keys** is used for `PartialAggregator`. Here, `key` and `offset` need to be considered, where each key represents a unique memory address, denoted as the function parameter place.
- **serialize** serializes the **state** in the aggregation process into binary.
- **deserialize** deserializes the binary into **state**.
- **merge** is used to\* merge other state into the current state.
- **merge_result** can merge the **Aggregate Function state** into a single value.

## Example

**Take avg as an example**

The implementation details can be found in [aggregate_avg.rs](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/blob/d5e06af03ba0f99afdd6bdc974bf2f5c1c022db8/src/query/functions/src/aggregates/aggregate_avg.rs).

Because we need to accumulate each value and divide them by the total number of non-null rows, the `avg` function is defined as a struct `AggregateAvgFunction<T, SumT>` where `T` and `SumT` are logical types that implement [Number](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/blob/2aec38605eebb7f0e1717f7f54ec52ae0f2e530b/src/query/expression/src/types/number.rs).

During the aggregation process, the avg function will get the sum of accumulated values and the number of non-null rows already scanned. Therefore, `AggregateAvgState` can be defined as the following structure:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct AggregateAvgState<T: Number> {
    #[serde(bound(deserialize = "T: DeserializeOwned"))]
    pub value: T,
    pub count: u64,
}
```

- **return_type** is set to `Float64Type`. For example, `value = 3`, `count = 2`, and `avg = value/count`.
- **init_state** initializes the state with the value of `T`'s default and count set to `0`.
- **accumulate** accumulates count and value of `AggregateAvgState` for non-null rows in the block.
- **accumulate_keys** gets and updates the corresponding state value with `place.get::<AggregateAvgState<SumT>>()`.

```rust
fn accumulate_keys(
    &self,
    places: &[StateAddr],
    offset: usize,
    columns: &[Column],
    _input_rows: usize,
) -> Result<()> {
    let darray = NumberType::<T>::try_downcast_column(&columns[0]).unwrap();
    darray.iter().zip(places.iter()).for_each(|(c, place)| {
        let place = place.next(offset);
        let state = place.get::<AggregateAvgState<SumT>>();
        state.add(c.as_(), 1);
    });
    Ok(())
}
```

## Refer to other examples

As you see, adding a new aggregate function in Databend is not as hard as you think.
Before you start to add one, please refer to other aggregate function examples, such as `sum`, `count`.

- [sum](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/blob/d5e06af03ba0f99afdd6bdc974bf2f5c1c022db8/src/query/functions/src/aggregates/aggregate_sum.rs)
- [count](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/blob/d5e06af03ba0f99afdd6bdc974bf2f5c1c022db8/src/query/functions/src/aggregates/aggregate_count.rs)

## Testing

As a good developer, you always test your code, don't you? Please add unit tests and logic tests after you complete the new aggregate functions.

### Unit Test

The unit tests for aggregate functions are located in [agg.rs](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/blob/d5e06af03ba0f99afdd6bdc974bf2f5c1c022db8/src/query/functions/tests/it/aggregates/agg.rs).

### Logic Test

The logic tests for functions are located in [tests/logictest/suites/base/02_function/](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/tree/d5e06af03ba0f99afdd6bdc974bf2f5c1c022db8/tests/sqllogictests/suites/query/02_function).
