  Meta and Query Service Metrics
---

Metrics are crucial to monitor the performance and health of the system. Databend collects and stores two types of metrics, Meta Metrics and Query Metrics, in the format of [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/). Meta Metrics are used for real-time monitoring and debugging of the Metasrv component, while Query Metrics are used for monitoring the performance of the Databend-query component.

You can access the metrics through a web browser using the following URLs:

- Meta Metrics: `http://<admin_api_address>/v1/metrics`. Defaults to `0.0.0.0:28101/v1/metrics`.
- Query Metrics: `http://<metric_api_address>/metrics`. Defaults to `0.0.0.0:7070/metrics`.

Alternatively, you can visualize the metrics using third-party tools. For information about supported tools and integration tutorials, refer to **Monitor** > **Using 3rd-party Tools**. When employing the Prometheus & Grafana solution, you can create dashboards using our provided dashboard templates, available [here](https://github.com/datafuselabs/helm-charts/tree/main/dashboards). For more details, check out the [Prometheus & Grafana](tools/prometheus-and-grafana.md) guide.

## Meta Metrics

Here's a list of Meta metrics captured by Databend.

### Server

These metrics describe the status of the `metasrv`. All these metrics are prefixed with `metasrv_server_`.

| Name              | Description                                       | Type    |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------|
| current_leader_id | Current leader id of cluster, 0 means no leader.  | Gauge   |
| is_leader         | Whether or not this node is current leader.       | Gauge   |
| node_is_health    | Whether or not this node is health.               | Gauge   |
| leader_changes    | Number of leader changes seen.                    | Counter |
| applying_snapshot | Whether or not statemachine is applying snapshot. | Gauge   |
| proposals_applied | Total number of consensus proposals applied.      | Gauge   |
| last_log_index    | Index of the last log entry..                     | Gauge   |
| current_term      | Current term.                                     | Gauge   |
| proposals_pending | Total number of pending proposals.                | Gauge   |
| proposals_failed  | Total number of failed proposals.                 | Counter |
| watchers          | Total number of active watchers.                  | Gauge   |

`current_leader_id` indicate current leader id of cluster, 0 means no leader. If a cluster has no leader, it is unavailable.

`is_leader` indicate if this `metasrv` currently is the leader of cluster, and `leader_changes` show the total number of leader changes since start.If change leader too frequently, it will impact the performance of `metasrv`, also it signal that the cluster is unstable.

If and only if the node state is `Follower` or `Leader` , `node_is_health` is 1, otherwise is 0.

`proposals_applied` records the total number of applied write requests.

`last_log_index` records the last log index has been appended to this Raft node's log, `current_term` records the current term of the Raft node.

`proposals_pending` indicates how many proposals are queued to commit currently.Rising pending proposals suggests there is a high client load or the member cannot commit proposals.

`proposals_failed` show the total number of failed write requests, it is normally related to two issues: temporary failures related to a leader election or longer downtime caused by a loss of quorum in the cluster.

`watchers` show the total number of active watchers currently.

### Raft Network

These metrics describe the network status of raft nodes in the `metasrv`. All these metrics are prefixed with `metasrv_raft_network_`.
