title: "TPC-H Benchmark: Databend Cloud vs. Snowflake"
sidebar_label: "TPC-H SF100 Benchmark"
---

## Quick Overview

### TPC-H

The TPC-H benchmark is a standard for evaluating decision support systems, focusing on complex queries and data maintenance. In this analysis, we compare Databend Cloud with Snowflake using the TPC-H SF100(SF1 = 6 Million Rows) dataset, encompassing 100GB of data and approximately 600 million rows across 22 queries.

### Snowflake and Databend Cloud

- **[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com)**: Snowflake is renowned for its advanced features such as separating storage and compute, scalable computing on demand, data sharing, and cloning capabilities.

- **[Databend Cloud](https://www.databend.com)**: Databend Cloud offers [similar functionalities](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/issues/13059) to Snowflake, being a cloud-native data warehouse that also separates storage from computing and provides scalable computing as needed.
 It is developed from the open-source [Databend project](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend), positioning itself as a modern, cost-effective alternative to Snowflake, especially for large-scale analytics.

## Performance and Cost Comparison

- **Data Loading Costs**: Databend achieves a **67% cost reduction** in data loading compared to Snowflake.
- **Query Execution Costs**: Databend approximately **60% less expensive** for query execution than Snowflake.

:::info Note

For this benchmark, no special tuning was applied. Both Snowflake and Databend Cloud were used with their default settings.
And remember, **don't just take our word for it — you're encouraged to run and verify these results yourself.**

## Reproduce the Benchmark

You can reproduce the benchmark by following the steps below.

### Benchmark Environment

Both Snowflake and Databend Cloud was tested under similar conditions:

| Parameter      | Snowflake                                                           | Databend Cloud                            |

- The TPC-H SF100 dataset, sourced from [Amazon Redshift](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-redshift-utils/tree/master/src/CloudDataWarehouseBenchmark/Cloud-DWB-Derived-from-TPCH), was loaded into both Databend Cloud and Snowflake without any specific tuning.

### Benchmark Methodology

We conducted both Cold and Hot runs for query execution:
1. **Cold Run**: The data warehouse was suspended and resumed before executing the queries.
2. **Hot Run**: The data warehouse is not suspended, local disk cache is used.

### Prerequisites

- Have a [Snowflake account](https://singup.snowflake.com)
- Create a [Databend Cloud account](https://www.databend.com/apply/).

### Data Loading

1. **Snowflake Data Load**:
    - Log into your [Snowflake account](https://app.snowflake.com/).
    - Create tables corresponding to the TPC-H schema. [SQL Script](https://github.com/datafuselabs/wizard/blob/ee9b72a11ac5d977f9a81d17fa34eb47a02ef2ba/benchsb/sql/snow/setup.sql#L1-L92).
    - Use the `COPY INTO` command to load the data from AWS S3. [SQL Script](https://github.com/datafuselabs/wizard/blob/ee9b72a11ac5d977f9a81d17fa34eb47a02ef2ba/benchsb/sql/snow/setup.sql#L95-L102).

2. **Databend Cloud Data Load**:
    - Sign in to your [Databend Cloud account](https://app.databend.com).
    - Create the necessary tables as per the TPC-H schema. [SQL Script](https://github.com/datafuselabs/wizard/blob/ee9b72a11ac5d977f9a81d17fa34eb47a02ef2ba/benchsb/sql/bend/setup.sql#L1-L92).
    - Utilize a similar method to Snowflake for loading data from AWS S3. [SQL Script](https://github.com/datafuselabs/wizard/blob/ee9b72a11ac5d977f9a81d17fa34eb47a02ef2ba/benchsb/sql/bend/setup.sql#L95-L133).

### TPC-H Queries

1. **Snowflake Queries**:
    - Log into your [Snowflake account](https://app.snowflake.com/).
    - Run the TPC-H queries. [SQL Script](https://github.com/datafuselabs/wizard/blob/ee9b72a11ac5d977f9a81d17fa34eb47a02ef2ba/benchsb/sql/snow/queries.sql#L1-L651).

2. **Databend Cloud Queries**:
    - Sign in to your [Databend Cloud account](https://app.databend.com).
    - Run the TPC-H queries. [SQL Script](https://github.com/datafuselabs/wizard/blob/ee9b72a11ac5d977f9a81d17fa34eb47a02ef2ba/benchsb/sql/bend/queries.sql#L1-L651).
