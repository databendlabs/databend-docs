:::note
To ensure efficient and stable data synchronization and import, we strongly recommend choosing a cloud service that matches the cloud provider and region you are currently using. This will help effectively avoid potential network delays and data loss risks associated with cross-network data transfers, ensuring the security and smoothness of the data transmission process, while significantly improving the efficiency and stability of data synchronization and import.
Databend Cloud plans to expand support for more cloud providers and regions. If your current cloud provider or region is not supported, please click [Contact Sales](https://www.databend.com/contact-us/) to get in touch with the Databend Cloud team.
