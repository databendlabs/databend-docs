### Set up your account

- **Organization name**: If the organization name textbox is empty, enter your organization name. By doing so, you're signing up for your organization with your account as an Admin account. If you're invited by a user who already belongs to an organization in Databand Cloud, the textbox will show that organization's name and you cannot edit it.
