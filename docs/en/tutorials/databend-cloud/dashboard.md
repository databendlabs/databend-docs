import StepsWrap from '@site/src/components/StepsWrap';
import StepContent from '@site/src/components/Steps/step-content';

In this tutorial, we'll load, analyze, and create a dashboard for a dataset named "Covid-19 Data from New York Times". The dataset comprises daily updated information on Covid-19 cases, deaths, and other pertinent statistics for the entire United States. It offers a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact at the national, state, and county levels, providing detailed insights into the Covid-19 situation across various regions throughout the year 2022.

| Field    | Description                                       |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| date     | The date of the reported cumulative Covid-19 data.|
| county   | The name of the county for the data entry.        |
| state    | The name of the state for the data entry.         |
| fips     | The FIPS code associated with the location.      |
| cases    | The cumulative number of confirmed Covid-19 cases.|
| deaths   | The cumulative number of deaths due to Covid-19.  |

### Step 1: Preparing Data

The dataset "Covid-19 Data from New York Times" is a built-in sample dataset that you can load with just a few clicks. The target table is created automatically, so you don't need to create it in advance.

### Handling NULLs

Before the analytics work, it is recommended to check for NULL and duplicate values in the table, as they may impact the results.

1. Create a worksheet and check the existence of NULLs in the table with the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM covid_19_us_2022_3812
WHERE date IS NULL OR country IS NULL OR state IS NULL OR fips IS NULL OR cases IS NULL OR deaths IS NULL;
```

This SQL statement returns `41571`, indicating the number of rows that contain at least one NULL value.

2. Remove the rows that contain at least one NULL value from the table:

```sql
DELETE FROM covid_19_us_2022_3812
WHERE date IS NULL OR country IS NULL OR state IS NULL OR fips IS NULL OR cases IS NULL OR deaths IS NULL;
```

### Handling Duplicates

1. In the same worksheet, check for duplicate values in the table with the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT date, country, state, fips, cases, deaths, COUNT(*)
FROM covid_19_us_2022_3812
GROUP BY date, country, state, fips, cases, deaths
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

This SQL statement returns `0`, indicating there are no duplicate rows in the table, and the data is now ready for analytics.

### Step 2: Creating Charts with Query Results

In this step, we'll run four queries to extract insights from the data and visualize the results through a scorecard, pie chart, bar chart, and line chart. **Please create a separate worksheet for each query**.

### US Total Deaths in 2022

1. Run the following SQL statement in a worksheet:

```sql
-- Calculate the total number of deaths in the US on December 31, 2022
SELECT SUM(deaths)
FROM covid_19_us_2022_3812
WHERE date = '2022-12-31';
```

2. Create a scorecard within the worksheet using the query result:

### Total Deaths by State in 2022

1. Run the following SQL statement in a worksheet:

```sql
-- Calculate the total number of deaths by state on December 31, 2022
SELECT state, SUM(deaths)
FROM covid_19_us_2022_3812
WHERE date = '2022-12-31'
GROUP BY state;
```

2. Create a pie chart within the worksheet using the query result:

SELECT * FROM covid_19_us_2022_3812
WHERE date = '2022-12-31' AND state = 'Virgin Islands';
```

2. Create a bar chart within the worksheet using the query result:

### Cumulative Cases & Deaths per Month in St. John

1. Run the following SQL statement in a worksheet:

```sql
-- Retrieve data for St. John at the end of each month
SELECT * FROM covid_19_us_2022_3812
WHERE
    (date = '2022-01-31'
    OR date = '2022-02-28'
    OR date = '2022-03-31'
    OR date = '2022-04-30'
    OR date = '2022-05-31'
    OR date = '2022-06-30'
    OR date = '2022-07-31'
    OR date = '2022-08-31'
    OR date = '2022-09-30'
    OR date = '2022-10-31'
    OR date = '2022-11-30'
    OR date = '2022-12-31')
    AND country = 'St. John' ORDER BY date;
```

2. Create a line chart within the worksheet using the query result:
