title: Analyzing AWS Billing
---

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of importing AWS billing data and conducting cost analysis using SQL. You'll learn how to load the AWS billing data into Databend Cloud, query it to find key cost drivers, and gain insights into your AWS usage.

AWS billing data provides a comprehensive breakdown of your cloud service usage and associated costs, which can be exported in Parquet format directly from the AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) service in the AWS Billing Console. In this tutorial, we'll be working with a sample dataset in Parquet format, available at [https://datasets.databend.com/aws-billing.parquet](https://datasets.databend.com/aws-billing.parquet). The dataset follows the CUR standards, which include fields like service names, usage types, and pricing details. For a complete schema reference, you can refer to the [AWS Cost and Usage Report Data Dictionary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/data-dictionary.html).

## Step 1: Creating Target Table

Open a worksheet, create a database named `doc`, and then create a table named `aws_billing`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE doc;

4. Click **Confirm** to start the data loading.

## Step 3: Analyzing Costs with SQL

Now that your billing data is in place, you're ready to use SQL queries to analyze the AWS billing information. This step provides some examples to shed light on your spending and help you uncover key insights.

The following query identifies the most expensive services youâ€™ve used:

```sql
SELECT
    product_servicename AS Service,
    SUM(line_item_blended_cost) AS Total_Cost
FROM aws_billing
WHERE
    line_item_blended_cost IS NOT NULL
    AND product_servicename != ''
GROUP BY product_servicename
ORDER BY Total_Cost DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

The following query identifies the most expensive AWS EC2 resources:

```sql
SELECT
    line_item_line_item_description,
    SUM(line_item_blended_cost) AS Total_Cost
FROM aws_billing
WHERE
    product_servicename = 'Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud'
    AND line_item_blended_cost IS NOT NULL
    AND identity_line_item_id != ''
GROUP BY line_item_line_item_description
ORDER BY Total_Cost DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

The following query identifies the most expensive S3 buckets:

```sql
SELECT
    line_item_line_item_description,
    SUM(line_item_blended_cost) AS Cost    
FROM aws_billing
WHERE
    line_item_product_code = 'AmazonS3'
    AND line_item_line_item_description != ''
GROUP BY line_item_line_item_description
ORDER BY Cost DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

The following query identifies the top 25 most expensive regions based on blended costs:

```sql
SELECT
    product_region AS Region,
    SUM(line_item_blended_cost) AS Total_Cost
FROM aws_billing
WHERE
    line_item_blended_cost IS NOT NULL
    AND product_region IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY product_region
ORDER BY Total_Cost DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

The following query categorizes your costs into Reserved Instances and On-Demand instances to help you understand how each type contributes to your total spending:

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN reservation_amortized_upfront_cost_for_usage IS NOT NULL THEN 'Reserved Instances'
        ELSE 'On-Demand'
    END AS Instance_Type,
    SUM(line_item_blended_cost) AS Total_Cost
FROM aws_billing
WHERE
    line_item_blended_cost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Instance_Type
ORDER BY Total_Cost DESC;
```
