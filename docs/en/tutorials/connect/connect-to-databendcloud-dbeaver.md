### Obtain Connection Information

Before creating a connection to Databend Cloud, you need to log in to Databend Cloud to obtain connection information. For more information, see [Connecting to a Warehouse](/guides/cloud/using-databend-cloud/warehouses#connecting). In this tutorial, we will use the following connection information:

> **Note**:
> If your `user` or `password` contains special characters, you need to provide them separately in the corresponding fields (e.g., the `Username` and `Password` fields in DBeaver). In this case, Databend will handle the necessary encoding for you. However, if you're providing the credentials together (e.g., as `user:password`), you must ensure that the entire string is properly encoded before use.
