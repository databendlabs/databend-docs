In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of connecting to a self-hosted Databend instance through the Databend JDBC driver as the user `root`.

### Before You Start

- Ensure that you have a local Databend instance ready for testing. See [Docker and Local Deployments](/guides/deploy/deploy/non-production/deploying-local) for detailed instructions.
- In this tutorial, you will use the `root` account to connect to Databend. During deployment, uncomment the following lines in the [databend-query.toml](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/blob/main/scripts/distribution/configs/databend-query.toml) configuration file to select this account:

  ```sql title="databend-query.toml"
  [[query.users]]
  name = "root"
  auth_type = "no_password"
  ```

- Ensure you have added the Databend JDBC driver to your DBeaver. See [Adding Databend JDBC Driver to DBeaver](/guides/sql-clients/jdbc/#adding-databend-jdbc-driver-to-dbeaver) for detailed instructions.

2. Configure your connection settings if needed. The default settings connect to a local instance of Databend as the user `root`.
