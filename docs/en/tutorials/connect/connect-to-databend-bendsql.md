In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of connecting to a self-hosted Databend instance using BendSQL as the user `root`.

### Before You Start

- Ensure that BendSQL is installed on your machine. See [Installing BendSQL](/guides/sql-clients/bendsql/#installing-bendsql) for instructions on how to install BendSQL using various package managers.
- Ensure that your Databend instance has started up successfully.
- In this tutorial, you will use the `root` account to connect to Databend. During deployment, uncomment the following lines in the [databend-query.toml](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/blob/main/scripts/distribution/configs/databend-query.toml) configuration file to select this account:

  ```sql title="databend-query.toml"
  [[query.users]]
  name = "root"
  auth_type = "no_password"
  ```

### Launch BendSQL

To launch BendSQL, enter `bendsql` directly into your terminal or command prompt.

:::note
The command `bendsql` launches and connects BendSQL to the local Databend at 127.0.0.1 using the `root` user without requiring a password. If you wish to connect to a local Databend with a different user, such as 'eric' with the password 'abc123', use the command `bendsql --user eric --password abc123`. To view all available arguments and their default values, type `bendsql --help`.
