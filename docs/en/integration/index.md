# Integrations

Databend integrations are organized by their support level:

**Core integrations**: built or maintained by Databend, they are supported by Databend and live in the Databend GitHub organization

**Partner integrations**: built or maintained, and supported by, third-party software vendors

**Community integrations**: built or maintained and supported by community members. No direct support is available besides the public GitHub repositories and community Slack channels

Each integration is further categorized into [Language client](/developer/), [Data ingestion](/guides/load-data/load-db/), [Data visualization](/guides/visualize/) and [SQL client](/guides/sql-clients/) categories.
