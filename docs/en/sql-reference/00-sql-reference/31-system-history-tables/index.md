# System History Tables

System history tables are similar to system tables, but they store data persistently.

These tables are organized in the `system_history` schema and can be queried using standard SQL. They provide a robust foundation for operational insights, compliance reporting, and troubleshooting by enabling you to analyze historical events and trends within your Databend environment.
