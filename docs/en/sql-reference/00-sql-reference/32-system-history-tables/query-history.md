<EEFeature featureName='QUERY HISTORY'/>

**Complete SQL execution audit trail** - Records comprehensive details of all SQL queries executed in Databend. Each query generates two entries (start and finish), providing complete visibility into:

- **Performance Analysis**: Query duration, resource usage, and optimization opportunities
- **Security Auditing**: Who executed what queries, when, and from where
- **Compliance Tracking**: Complete audit trail for regulatory requirements
- **Usage Monitoring**: Database activity patterns and user behavior analysis
