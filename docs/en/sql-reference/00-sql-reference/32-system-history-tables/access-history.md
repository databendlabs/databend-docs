This table provides detailed logging of objects accessed and modified by each query, including tables, columns, and stages, as part of the query metadata. It provides structured information about DDL and DML operations to enhance auditing.


## Fields

| Field                   | Type      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| query_id                | VARCHAR   | The ID of the query.                                                        |
| query_start             | TIMESTAMP | The start time of the query.                                                |
| user_name               | VARCHAR   | The name of the user who executed the query.                                |
| base_objects_accessed   | VARIANT   | The objects accessed by the query.                                          |
| direct_objects_accessed | VARIANT   | Reserved for future use; currently not in use.                              |
| objects_modified        | VARIANT   | The objects modified by the query.                                          |
| object_modified_by_ddl  | VARIANT   | The objects modified by the DDL (e.g `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`).        |

The fields `base_objects_accessed`, `objects_modified`, and `object_modified_by_ddl` are all arrays of JSON objects. Each object may include the following fields:

- `object_domain`: The type of object, one of [`Database`, `Table`, `Stage`].
- `object_name`: The name of the object. For stages, this is the stage name.
- `columns`: Column information, present only when `object_domain` is `Table`.
- `stage_type`: The type of stage, present only when `object_domain` is `Stage`.
- `operation_type`: The DDL operation type, one of [`Create`, `Alter`, `Drop`, `Undrop`], present only in the `object_modified_by_ddl` field.
- `properties`: Detailed information about the DDL operation, present only in the `object_modified_by_ddl` field.

## Examples


```sql
CREATE TABLE t (a INT, b string);
```

Will be recorded as:

```
               query_id: c2c1c7be-cee4-4868-a28e-8862b122c365
            query_start: 2025-06-12 03:31:19.042128
              user_name: root
  base_objects_accessed: []
direct_objects_accessed: []
       objects_modified: []
 object_modified_by_ddl: [{"object_domain":"Table","object_name":"default.default.t","operation_type":"Create","properties":{"columns":[{"column_name":"a","sub_operation_type":"Add"},{"column_name":"b","sub_operation_type":"Add"}],"create_options":{"compression":"zstd","database_id":"1","storage_format":"parquet"}}}]
```

`CREATE TABLE` is a DDL operation, so it will be recorded in the `object_modified_by_ddl` field.


```sql
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, 'book');
```

Will be recorded as:

```
               query_id: e92ebc00-a07e-4138-92a9-ea17a06f0165
            query_start: 2025-06-12 03:31:29.849848
              user_name: root
  base_objects_accessed: []
direct_objects_accessed: []
       objects_modified: [{"columns":[{"column_name":"a"},{"column_name":"b"}],"object_domain":"Table","object_name":"default.default.t"}]
 object_modified_by_ddl: []
```

`INSERT INTO` is a DML operation, so it will be recorded in the `objects_modified` field.


```sql
COPY INTO @s FROM t;
```

```
               query_id: 7fd74374-c04a-4989-a6f7-bfe8cc27e511
            query_start: 2025-06-12 03:32:25.682248
              user_name: root
  base_objects_accessed: [{"columns":[{"column_name":"a"},{"column_name":"b"}],"object_domain":"Table","object_name":"default.default.t"}]
direct_objects_accessed: []
       objects_modified: [{"object_domain":"Stage","object_name":"s","stage_type":"Internal"}]
 object_modified_by_ddl: []
```

The `COPY INTO` operation from table `t` to internal stage `s` involves both read and write actions. After executing this query, the source table will be recorded in the `base_objects_accessed` field, and the target stage will be recorded in the `objects_modified` field.
