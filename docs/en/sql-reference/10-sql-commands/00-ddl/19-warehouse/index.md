Warehouse-related SQL commands for Databend Cloud.

## General Rules

- **Warehouse naming**: 3–63 characters, `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-` only.
- **Strings and identifiers**: Bare identifiers may omit quotes when they contain no spaces; otherwise enclose with single quotes. Grammar allows keywords or numeric/boolean literals as names, but runtime validation still applies.
- **Numeric parameters**: `nullable_unsigned_number` / `nullable_signed_number` accept integers or `NULL`. Supplying `NULL` resets the value (for example, `AUTO_SUSPEND = NULL` equals `0`).
- **Time parameters**: `QUERY_HISTORY` uses `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (UTC or explicit timezone). Missing fractional seconds are interpreted as whole seconds.
- **Boolean parameters**: Only `TRUE`/`FALSE` are accepted.
- **`WITH` keyword**: May appear before the entire option list or ahead of each option. Options are whitespace-separated; commas are not part of the grammar.

## Warehouse Management

Tags are key-value pairs that help categorize and organize warehouses, similar to AWS resource tags. They are commonly used for:

- **Cost allocation**: Track warehouse costs by team, project, or cost center
- **Environment identification**: Mark warehouses as dev, staging, or production
- **Team ownership**: Identify which team owns or manages a warehouse
- **Custom metadata**: Add any arbitrary metadata for organizational purposes

Tag keys and values are arbitrary strings (enclosed in quotes if they contain spaces or special characters). Tags can be:
- Added at warehouse creation time using `WITH TAG (key = 'value', ...)`
- Updated or added later using `ALTER WAREHOUSE ... SET TAG key = 'value'`
- Removed using `ALTER WAREHOUSE ... UNSET TAG key`

Tags are returned in API responses and visible through `SHOW WAREHOUSES`.

**Tag Limits:**
- Maximum 10 tags per warehouse
- Tag name (key) maximum length: 128 characters
- Tag value maximum length: 256 characters
