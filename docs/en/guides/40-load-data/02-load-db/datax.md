## DatabendWriter

DatabendWriter is an integrated plugin of DataX, which means it comes pre-installed and does not require any manual installation. It acts as a seamless connector that enables the effortless transfer of data from other databases to Databend. With DatabendWriter, you can leverage the capabilities of DataX to efficiently load data from various databases into Databend. 

DatabendWriter supports two operational modes: INSERT (default) and REPLACE. In INSERT Mode, new data is added while conflicts with existing records are prevented to maintain data integrity. On the other hand, the REPLACE Mode prioritizes data consistency by replacing existing records with newer data in case of conflicts.

If you need more information about DatabendWriter and its functionalities, you can refer to the documentation available at https://github.com/alibaba/DataX/blob/master/databendwriter/doc/databendwriter.md
