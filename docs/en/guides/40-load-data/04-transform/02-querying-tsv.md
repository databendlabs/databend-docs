## Query TSV Files in Stage

Syntax:
```sql
SELECT [<alias>.]$<col_position> [, $<col_position> ...] 
FROM {@<stage_name>[/<path>] [<table_alias>] | '<uri>' [<table_alias>]} 
[( 
  [<connection_parameters>],
  [ PATTERN => '<regex_pattern>'],
  [ FILE_FORMAT => 'TSV| <custom_format_name>'],
  [ FILES => ( '<file_name>' [ , '<file_name>' ] [ , ... ] ) ]
)]
```


:::info Tips
TSV doesn't have schema information, so we can only query the columns `$<col_position> [, $<col_position> ...]` by position.

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Create an External Stage

Create an external stage with your own S3 bucket and credentials where your TSV files are stored.
```sql
CREATE STAGE tsv_query_stage 
URL = 's3://load/tsv/' 
CONNECTION = (
    ACCESS_KEY_ID = '<your-access-key-id>' 
    SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = '<your-secret-access-key>'
);
```

### Step 2. Create Custom TSV File Format

```sql
CREATE FILE FORMAT tsv_query_format 
    TYPE = TSV,
    RECORD_DELIMITER = '\n',
    FIELD_DELIMITER = ',',
    COMPRESSION = AUTO;
```

- More TSV file format options refer to [TSV File Format Options](/sql/sql-reference/file-format-options#tsv-options)

### Step 3. Query TSV Files

```sql
SELECT $1, $2, $3
FROM @tsv_query_stage
(
    FILE_FORMAT => 'tsv_query_format',
    PATTERN => '.*[.]tsv'
);
```

If the TSV files is compressed with gzip, we can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT $1, $2, $3
FROM @tsv_query_stage
(
    FILE_FORMAT => 'tsv_query_format',
    PATTERN => '.*[.]tsv[.]gz'
);
```
