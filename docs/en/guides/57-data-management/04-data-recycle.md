title: Data Purge and Recycle

In Databend, the data is not truly deleted when you run `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, or `DELETE` commands, allowing for time travel back to previous states.

There are two types of data:

- **History Data**: Used by Time Travel to store historical data or data from dropped tables.
- **Temporary Data**: Used by the system to store spilled data.

If the data size is significant, you can run several commands ([Enterprise Edition Features](/guides/products/dee/enterprise-features)) to delete these data and free up storage space.

## Spill Data Storage

Self-hosted Databend supports spilling intermediate query results to disk when memory usage exceeds available limits. Users can configure where spill data is stored, choosing between local disk storage and a remote S3-compatible bucket.

### Spill Storage Options

Databend provides the following spill storage configurations:

- Local Disk Storage: Spilled data is written to a specified local directory in the query node. Please note that local disk storage is supported only for [Windows Functions](/sql/sql-functions/window-functions/).
- Remote S3-Compatible Storage: Spilled data is stored in an external bucket.
- Default Storage: If no spill storage is configured, Databend spills data to the default storage bucket along with your table data.

### Spill Priority

If both local and S3-compatible spill storage are configured, Databend follows this order:

1. Spill to local disk first (if configured).
2. Spill to remote S3-compatible storage when local disk space is insufficient.
3. Spill to Databendâ€™s default storage bucket if neither local nor external S3-compatible storage is configured.

### Configuring Spill Storage

To configure spill storage, update the [databend-query.toml](https://github.com/databendlabs/databend/blob/main/scripts/distribution/configs/databend-query.toml) configuration file.

This example sets Databend to use up to 1 TB of local disk space for spill operations, while reserving 40% of the disk for system use:

```toml
[spill]
spill_local_disk_path = "/data1/databend/databend_spill"
spill_local_disk_reserved_space_percentage = 40
spill_local_disk_max_bytes = 1099511627776
```

This example sets Databend to use MinIO as an S3-compatible storage service for spill operations:

```toml
[spill]
[spill.storage]
type = "s3"
[spill.storage.s3]
bucket = "databend"
root = "admin"
endpoint_url = "http://127.0.0.1:9900"
access_key_id = "minioadmin"
secret_access_key = "minioadmin"
allow_insecure = true
```

## Purge Drop Table Data

Deletes data files of all dropped tables, freeing up storage space.

```sql
VACUUM DROP TABLE;
```

See more [VACUUM DROP TABLE](/sql/sql-commands/administration-cmds/vacuum-drop-table).

## Purge Table History Data

Removes historical data for a specified table, clearing old versions and freeing storage.

```sql
VACUUM TABLE <table_name>;
```

See more [VACUUM TABLE](/sql/sql-commands/administration-cmds/vacuum-table).

## Purge Temporary Data

Clears temporary spilled files used for joins, aggregates, and sorts, freeing up storage space.

```sql
VACUUM TEMPORARY FILES;
```

See more [VACUUM TEMPORARY FILES](/sql/sql-commands/administration-cmds/vacuum-temp-files).
