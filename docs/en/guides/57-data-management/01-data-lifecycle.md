## Organizing Data

Arrange your data in databases and tables.

Key Commands:

- [`CREATE DATABASE`](/sql/sql-commands/ddl/database/ddl-create-database): To create a new database.
- [`ALTER DATABASE`](/sql/sql-commands/ddl/database/ddl-alter-database): To modify an existing database.
- [`CREATE TABLE`](/sql/sql-commands/ddl/table/ddl-create-table): To create a new table.
- [`ALTER TABLE`](/sql/sql-commands/ddl/table/alter-table-column): To modify an existing table.

## Storing Data

Directly add data to your tables. Databend also allows importing data from external files into its tables.

Key Commands:

- [`INSERT`](/sql/sql-commands/dml/dml-insert): To add data to a table.
- [`COPY INTO <table>`](/sql/sql-commands/dml/dml-copy-into-table): To bring in data from an external file.

## Querying Data

After your data is in the tables, use `SELECT` to look at and analyze it.

Key Command:

- [`SELECT`](/sql/sql-commands/query-syntax/query-select): To get data from a table.

## Working with Data

Once your data is in Databend, you can update, replace, merge, or delete it as needed.

Key Commands:

- [`UPDATE`](/sql/sql-commands/dml/dml-update): To change data in a table.
- [`REPLACE`](/sql/sql-commands/dml/dml-replace): To replace existing data.
- [`MERGE`](/sql/sql-commands/dml/dml-merge): To seamlessly insert, update, and delete by comparing data between main and source tables or subqueries.
- [`DELETE`](/sql/sql-commands/dml/dml-delete-from): To remove data from a table.

## Removing Data

Databend allows you to delete specific data or entire tables and databases.

Key Commands:

- [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](/sql/sql-commands/ddl/table/ddl-truncate-table): To clear a table without deleting its structure.
- [`DROP TABLE`](/sql/sql-commands/ddl/table/ddl-drop-table): To remove a table.
- [`DROP DATABASE`](/sql/sql-commands/ddl/database/ddl-drop-database): To delete a database.
