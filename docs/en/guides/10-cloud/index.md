# Databend Cloud

Databend Cloud is not just Databend hosted in the cloud — it's a complete cloud-native data platform with multi-tenant, serverless architecture. Like Snowflake, it delivers instant elasticity, true pay-per-query economics, and enterprise-grade capabilities, all without infrastructure overhead.
