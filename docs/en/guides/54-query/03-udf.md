User-Defined Functions (UDFs) offer enhanced flexibility by supporting both anonymous lambda expressions and predefined handlers (JavaScript & WebAssembly) for defining UDFs. These features allow users to create custom operations tailored to their specific data processing needs. Databend UDFs are categorized into the following types:

- [Lambda UDFs](#lambda-udf)
- [Embedded UDFs](#embedded-udfs)

Databend provides a variety of commands to manage UDFs. For details, see [User-Defined Function](/sql/sql-commands/ddl/udf/).

## Lambda UDF

A lambda UDF allows users to define custom operations using anonymous functions (lambda expressions) directly within their queries. These lambda expressions are often concise and can be used to perform specific data transformations or computations that may not be achievable using built-in functions alone.

### Usage Examples

This example creates UDFs to extract specific values from JSON data within a table using SQL queries.

```sql
-- Define UDFs
CREATE FUNCTION get_v1 AS (json) -> json["v1"];
CREATE FUNCTION get_v2 AS (json) -> json["v2"];

-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE json_table(time TIMESTAMP, data JSON);

-- Insert a time event
INSERT INTO json_table VALUES('2022-06-01 00:00:00.00000', PARSE_JSON('{"v1":1.5, "v2":20.5}'));

-- Get v1 and v2 value from the event
SELECT get_v1(data), get_v2(data) FROM json_table;
+------------+------------+
| data['v1'] | data['v2'] |
+------------+------------+
| 1.5        | 20.5       |
+------------+------------+
```

## Embedded UDFs

Embedded UDFs allow you to embed code written in the following programming languages within SQL:

- [JavaScript](#javascript)
- [WebAssembly](#webassembly)

:::note
If your program content is large, you can compress it and then pass it to the stage. See the [Usage Examples](#usage-examples-2) for WebAssembly.

### JavaScript

A JavaScript UDF allows you to invoke JavaScript code from a SQL query via Databend's built-in handler, enabling seamless integration of JavaScript logic within your SQL queries. 

#### Data Type Mappings

The following table shows the type mapping between Databend and JavaScript:

| Databend Type     | JS Type    |
|-------------------|------------|
| NULL              | null       |
| BOOLEAN           | Boolean    |
| TINYINT           | Number     |
| TINYINT UNSIGNED  | Number     |
| SMALLINT          | Number     |
| SMALLINT UNSIGNED | Number     |
| INT               | Number     |
| INT UNSIGNED      | Number     |
| BIGINT            | Number     |
| BIGINT UNSIGNED   | Number     |
| FLOAT             | Number     |
| DOUBLE            | Number     |
| STRING            | String     |
| DATE / TIMESTAMP  | Date       |
| DECIMAL           | BigDecimal |
| BINARY            | Uint8Array |

#### Usage Examples

This example defines a JavaScript UDF named "gcd_js" to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, and applies it within a SQL query:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION gcd_js (INT, INT) RETURNS BIGINT LANGUAGE javascript HANDLER = 'gcd_js' AS $$
export function gcd_js(a, b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        let t = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = t;
    }
    return a;
}
$$

SELECT
    number,
    gcd_js((number * 3), (number * 6))
FROM
    numbers(5)
WHERE
    (number > 0)
ORDER BY 1;
```

### WebAssembly

A WebAssembly UDF allows users to define custom logic or operations using languages that compile to WebAssembly. These UDFs can then be invoked directly within SQL queries to perform specific computations or data transformations.

#### Usage Examples

In this example, the "wasm_gcd" function is created to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The function is defined using WebAssembly and its implementation resides in the 'test10_udf_wasm_gcd.wasm.zst' binary file.

Prior to its execution, the function implementation undergoes a series of steps. First, it is compiled into a binary file, followed by compression into 'test10_udf_wasm_gcd.wasm.zst'. Finally, the compressed file is uploaded to a stage in advance.

:::note
The function can be implemented in Rust, as demonstrated in the example available at https://github.com/risingwavelabs/arrow-udf/blob/main/arrow-udf-wasm/examples/wasm.rs
:::

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION wasm_gcd (INT, INT) RETURNS INT LANGUAGE wasm HANDLER = 'wasm_gcd(int4,int4)->int4' AS $$@data/udf/test10_udf_wasm_gcd.wasm.zst$$;

SELECT
    number,
    wasm_gcd((number * 3), (number * 6))
FROM
    numbers(5)
WHERE
    (number > 0)
ORDER BY 1;
```
