title: Stored Procedure
---

A stored procedure is a set of executable commands or logic blocks stored within the database, written in SQL or other programming languages, designed to be reusable for efficiently performing specific tasks or operations.

## Supported Languages

**Databend currently supports [SQL Scripting](/sql/sql-reference/sql-scripting) only**. Using SQL scripting, users can define procedures with control flow constructs like loops (FOR, WHILE, REPEAT) and conditionals (IF, CASE), enabling complex logic and effective multi-step operations.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when working with stored procedures:

- Stored procedures are an experimental feature. Before working with them, set `enable_experimental_procedure` to 1;

    ```sql
    SET enable_experimental_procedure = 1;
    ```

- Stored procedures return results as strings, regardless of the specified return type, without enforcing the declared type on the returned value.

## Managing Stored Procedures

Databend offers a range of commands for managing stored procedures. For more details, see [Stored Procedure](/sql/sql-commands/ddl/procedure/).

## Usage Example

Suppose we want to calculate the sum of all even numbers within a given range. This stored procedure accepts a starting value start_val and an ending value end_val and calculates the sum of all even numbers within this range.

```sql
SET enable_experimental_procedure = 1;

CREATE PROCEDURE sum_even_numbers(start_val UInt8, end_val UInt8) 
RETURNS UInt8 NOT NULL 
LANGUAGE SQL 
COMMENT='Calculate the sum of all even numbers' 
AS $$
BEGIN
    LET sum := 0;
    FOR i IN start_val TO end_val DO
        IF i % 2 = 0 THEN
            sum := sum + i;
        END IF;
    END FOR;
    
    RETURN sum;
END;
$$;
```

If we want to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10, we can call the procedure as follows:

```sql
CALL PROCEDURE sum_even_numbers(1, 10);

-- Result: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30
┌────────┐
│ Result │
├────────┤
│ 30     │
└────────┘
```
