### Set up your account

- **Organization name**: If the organization name textbox is empty, enter your organization name. By doing so, you're signing up for your organization with your account as an Admin account. If you're invited by a user who already belongs to an organization in Databand Cloud, the textbox will show that organization's name and you cannot edit it.

### Select cloud provider and region

Please note that this step is visible only to users who sign up for their organization. After you complete the setup, click **Create** to enter Databend Cloud.

- **Cloud provider**: Databend Cloud currently runs on AWS, and will support Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform in a future release. Databend Cloud works almost the same from the front end on any of the clouds. If you already have been using one of the clouds, select that one. 

- **Region**: The region decides where your Databend Cloud will be hosted. Select the region based on your locality and business needs. For example, if you have a requirement to have your Databend Cloud hosted in Asia, select a region of Asia.  Please note that the available regions vary depending on the cloud provider you select.
