A catalog in Databend serves as a fundamental organizational concept, essential for efficiently managing and accessing data sources. It acts as a central repository for storing metadata information about your data, allowing you to query external catalogs without having to load the data into Databend.

Databend offers support for two primary catalog types: [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) and [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/). If you want to explore these catalog types further, you can find detailed information on their respective official websites. It's worth noting that Databend currently exclusively supports the Parquet format for both Iceberg and Hive dataset files.

If you're interested in learning how to work with Apache Iceberg and Apache Hive catalogs in Databend, you can find comprehensive guides and documentation at the following links:
