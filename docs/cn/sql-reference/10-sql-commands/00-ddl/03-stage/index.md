A stage is a storage location where data files are temporarily held before being loaded into a table or exported to an external system. Databend provides three types of stages to meet different needs. For more information about the Databend stage types, see [Understanding Stages](/guides/load-data/stage/whystage).

Databend offers a variety of stage commands to help you manage your stages. For a brief description of their usage, see [Managing Stages](/guides/load-data/stage/manage-stages).
