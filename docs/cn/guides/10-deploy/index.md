title: Deploy & Upgrade Databend
---

## Overview

These guides provide detailed instructions for deploying and upgrading Databend, catering to both the [Databend Community Edition](../00-overview/00-editions/00-dce/index.md) and [Databend Enterprise Edition](../00-overview/00-editions/01-dee/index.md). 

If you're using [Databend Cloud](../00-overview/00-editions/02-dc/index.md), please feel free to ignore these guides. In other words, there's no need for you to manage the deployment and upgrades yourself.
