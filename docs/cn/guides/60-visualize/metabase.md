## Tutorial: Integrating with Metabase

This tutorial guides you through the process of integrating Databend / Databend Cloud with Metabase using the Metabase Databend Driver. 

### Step 1. Set up Environment

To follow along, you'll need to install Metabase with Docker. Before you begin, make sure that Docker is installed on your system.

For this tutorial, you can integrate either with Databend or Databend Cloud:

- If you choose to integrate with a local Databend instance, follow the [Deployment Guide](/guides/deploy) to deploy it if you don't have one already.
- If you prefer to integrate with Databend Cloud, make sure you can log in to your account and obtain the connection information for a warehouse. For more details, see [Connecting to a Warehouse](/guides/cloud/using-databend-cloud/warehouses#connecting).

### Step 2. Deploy Metabase

Follow these steps to install and deploy Metabase with Docker:

1. Pull the latest Docker image of Metabase from the Docker Hub registry.

```bash
docker pull metabase/metabase
```

2. Deploy Metabase.

```bash
docker run  -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase
```

3. [Download](https://github.com/databendcloud/metabase-databend-driver/releases/latest) the Metabase Databend Driver, then import it to the **plugins** folder of the Metabase container in Docker.
