[Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) is fast, lightweight, intuitive, and loaded with options that make it easy for users of all skill sets to explore and visualize their data, from simple line charts to highly detailed geospatial charts.

Databend integrates with Superset through two Python libraries: [databend-py](https://github.com/databendcloud/databend-py) and [databend-sqlalchemy](https://github.com/databendcloud/databend-sqlalchemy). To achieve this integration, you need to build a custom Docker image based on the official Superset Docker image, incorporating these two libraries. `databend-py` acts as the Python client library for Databend, allowing Superset to communicate with the Databend server, execute queries, and retrieve results through its API. Concurrently, `databend-sqlalchemy` serves as the SQLAlchemy adapter for Databend, enabling Superset to integrate with Databend using the SQLAlchemy framework. It facilitates the conversion of SQL queries generated by Superset into a format understandable by Databend through SQLAlchemy's interface.

## Tutorial: Integrating with Superset

This tutorial guides you through the process of integrating Databend Cloud with Superset.

<StepsWrap>
<StepContent number="1" title="Building Superset Image">

These steps involve creating a customized Superset Docker image with Databend integration:

1. Starts with the official Superset Docker image as the foundational base. Edit the Dockerfile, permissions are elevated to install essential packages.

```shell title='Dockerfile'
FROM apache/superset
# Switching to root to install the required packages
USER root
RUN pip install databend-py 
RUN pip install databend-sqlalchemy
# Switching back to using the `superset` user
USER superset
```

2. Build a Docker image with the tag "superset-databend:v0.0.1" using the current directory as the build context.

```shell
docker build -t superset-databend:v0.0.1 .
```

3. Run a Docker container using the "superset-databend:v0.0.1" image.

```shell
docker run -d -p 8080:8088 -e "SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>" --name superset --platform linux/x86_64 superset-databend:v0.0.1
```

<StepContent number="2" title="Setting Up Superset">

1. Create an administrator user.

```shell
docker exec -it superset superset fab create-admin \
           --username admin \
           --firstname Superset \
           --lastname Admin \
           --email admin@superset.com \
           --password admin
```

2. Apply any necessary database migrations to ensure that the Superset database schema is up to date.

```shell
docker exec -it superset superset db upgrade
```

3. Initializes Superset.

```shell
docker exec -it superset superset init
```

<StepContent number="3" title="Connecting to Databend Cloud">

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/login/]( http://localhost:8080/login/) and use the credentials `admin/admin` for the username and password to log in.

2. Select **Settings** > **Data** > **Connect Database** to open the connection wizard.

4. On the **BASIC** tab, set a display name, for example, `Databend`, and then enter the URI to connect to Databend Cloud. The URI follows the format: `databend://<host>`, where` <host>` corresponds to the host field in your warehouse's connection information. For information on how to obtain the connection details, refer to [Connecting to a Warehouse](/guides/cloud/using-databend-cloud/warehouses#connecting-to-a-warehouse).
