  Connect Databend from MySQL-compatible clients.
---

Databend provides support for MySQL compatible CLI and GUI clients where you can connect to Databend and execute queries from.

:::note
Databend is not a complete implementation of the MySQL protocol, so certain programs such as some ORM frameworks may not be able to connect to Databend.
:::

To connect to Databend with MySQL compatible clients, you will need to connect to port 3307 with a SQL user created in Databend. 

This example connects to a remote Databend with a SQL user named `databend`:

```shell
mysql -h172.20.0.2 -udatabend -P3307 -pdatabend
```

This example connects to a local Databend with the user `root`:

```shell
mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -P3307 
```
